# Star Wars Top Trumps

## Notes

A running preview of this project is available on [Netlify](https://infallible-kepler-085aec.netlify.com/)

This project doesn't include any line of CSS as it is full based on Bootstrap.

Added sample unit tests to Button component, Card component and DataContext.

## Task

We want you to have fun doing this test so we’ve chosen a subject matter that is a little unusual, but should be more fun that other tests you may have done.

Using SWAPI: [https://swapi.co/documentation](https://swapi.co/documentation)

Build an application to select random people or starships and render their details to see who would win based on a common attribute.
i.e. people have mass and starships have crew. A person with greater mass wins, a starship with more crew wins.

The app should render the attributes from the resource in a simple web page that allows you to ‘play’ the game.

Once two cards are displayed the app should declare one of the cards a winner based on the higher common attribute.

Having displayed the winning card, the user should be able to play again using an action button that repeats the same request.

Bonus points! These are not required, just adds to your portfolio in an interview:
1 - Score counter. If there are two players, left and right, show how many times each side has won.
2 - Option to select which resource to play against
3 - Use Bootstrap-4 and display the details in a [card](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/card)  and the winning attribute in [badges](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/components/badge)


## React APP

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
